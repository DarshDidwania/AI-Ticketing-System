1. The README.md File (Most Important)
This is the first thing anyone sees. It should be clear, concise, and informative. Create a file named README.md in the root directory of your project (the FULL-STACK-AI-AGENT folder).

Copy and paste the following template into your README.md file:

# AI-Powered Support Ticketing System

A full-stack application designed to streamline the technical support process. This project uses a Node.js backend with an AI agent (powered by Google's Gemini) to automatically analyze, prioritize, and assign support tickets created by users through a React-based frontend.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login system using JWT for session management.
* **Ticket Creation & Management:** Authenticated users can create, view, and track their support tickets.
* **AI-Powered Ticket Analysis:** When a new ticket is created, a background job is triggered:
    * **AI Summary:** Google's Gemini model summarizes the issue.
    * **Priority Estimation:** The AI estimates the ticket's priority (Low, Medium, High).
    * **Skill Identification:** Identifies the technical skills required to solve the issue.
    * **Helpful Notes:** Provides technical notes and resources for the support agent.
* **Automatic Assignment:** The system automatically assigns the ticket to a moderator with the relevant skills.
* **Email Notifications:** The assigned moderator receives an email notification about the new ticket.
* **Admin Panel:** An admin-only dashboard to view all users and manage their roles and skills.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB (with Mongoose)
* **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcrypt
* **Background Jobs:** Inngest
* **AI Integration:** Google Gemini
* **Email Service:** Nodemailer (with Mailtrap for development)

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name

2. Setup Backend:

cd ai-ticket-assistant
npm install

Create a .env file in this directory and add the following variables:

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=your_inngest_event_key
MAILTRAP_SMTP_HOST=your_mailtrap_host
MAILTRAP_SMTP_PORT=your_mailtrap_port
MAILTRAP_SMTP_USER=your_mailtrap_user
MAILTRAP_SMTP_PASS=your_mailtrap_pass

3. Setup Frontend:

cd ../ai-ticket-frontend
npm install

Create a .env file in this directory and add the following:

VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000

4. Run the application:

In the ai-ticket-assistant terminal, run: npm start

In the ai-ticket-frontend terminal, run: npm run dev

üöß Current Status & Known Issues
This project is currently a work-in-progress.

Core functionality (User Auth, AI Analysis, Background Jobs) is implemented.

Known Issue: There is a persistent CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error that prevents the frontend from successfully fetching data from the backend after the initial login. This is the primary issue currently being debugged.

üîÆ Future Improvements
Implement a real-time chat feature within the ticket details page.

Add file attachments to tickets.

Deploy the application to a cloud service like Vercel or AWS.

### 2. The `.gitignore` File (Very Important!)

This file tells Git which files and folders to ignore. It's crucial for preventing sensitive information (like your `.env` files with API keys) and unnecessary folders (like `node_modules`) from being uploaded to GitHub.

Create a file named `.gitignore` in the root directory of your project (`FULL-STACK-AI-AGENT`).

**Copy and paste the following into your `.gitignore` file:**


Dependency directories
node_modules/

Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

Build output
dist/
build/

Logs
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

IDE / Editor specific
.idea/
.vscode/
*.suo
.ntvs
*.njsproj
*.sln
*.sw?
